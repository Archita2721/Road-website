    <br>
    <p>Road Safety aims to advise and inform the road users about the reasons behind the accidents,
      measures to prevent users from being killed or seriously injured by factors affecting the same.
      Typical road users include pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, vehicle passengers, and passengers
      of on road pubic transport.
    </p>
    <p>Safe system for roads requires a systematic, multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral approach
      which addresses the safety needs of all users; fatal and serious injury collision prevention,
      collision protection and mitigation and post-collision care and aligns with other policies
      for co-benefits such as health, occupational health and safety, sustainable development and
      poverty reduction. In a Safe system approach, mobility is a function of safety rather than
      vice versa. It involves the implementation of system-wide measures that ensure,
      in the event of a collision, that the impact forces remain below the threshold likely
      to produce either death or serious injury.
    </p>
    <p>Safe system requires a proactive approach placing road safety in the mainstream of road traffic
      system planning, design and operation and use. Safe system interventions address common human
      errors and human tolerance to injury thresholds and in so doing aims to address the road safety
      needs of non-motorised as well as motorised road users, younger and older users, male and female
      sers.

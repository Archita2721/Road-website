                <p>63% of crashes are related to the roads with the speed limit of 30 mph and 14% with the speed of 60 mph. The crash count is at its highest in 30 mph speed limit because there are more urban roads with this speed limit which also are very tight and narrow somewhere in the UK specially in London. Due to traffic congestions in large cities, there are more likely for people to mistake during driving for example on crossways by not giving proper signals. </p>

                 <p>In Great Britian, around 100,000 crashes are reported in cities such as Brighton and Surrey. In Norfolk and Suffolk counties 80,000 crash are reported which is also a high number compared to the rest of areas like Plymouth, Scotland, and Wales. Traffic volume is increasing primarily because the economy is growing. As traffic volume increases, incidents also increase. As such, accidents continue to increase until economic development reaches a critical threshold. In order to counteract the effect of increased traffic, it becomes imperative to invest in better training, better vehicle standards, enforcement, and engineering. In this manner, even if traffic volumes continue to grow, the number of incidents and deaths begins to decline.</p>

              </h2>
              <p>This factsheet gives key statistics for older car drivers (aged 70 and over) involved in police reported road accidents involving personal injury in Great Britain up to 2020. Older car drivers are a notable set of road users because of the ageing population and also the increase in older driving licence holders. The factsheet examines the main trends on reported road collisions involving at least one older car driver and the casualties involved in these collisions.

                ‘Any age car drivers’ include drivers with an unknown age. Unless otherwise stated, figures for drivers relate to car drivers only, and older road users are those aged 70 and over.</p>

                    <li>In 2020, there were 5.6 million older people with a full driving licence in Great Britain. This accounted for around 14% of all full car licence holders (Chart 1).</li>
                    <li>Between 2016 and 2020, older people with a full driving licence increased both in licence numbers (23.6% from 4.5 to 5.6 million) and as a percentage of all people with full driving licences (1.9 percentage points from 11.7 to 13.6).</li>
                    <li>In the same period, the older population rose by 12% from 8.0 million to 8.9 million, whilst the percentage of older people with a full driving licence increased by 6 percentage points from 57% to 62%.</li>
                    <li>An additional 17,986 older people held a provisional driving licence in 2020.</li>

                  <h3><b>Older road user casualty rates by type</b></h3>
                  <p>Chart 2 shows that older casualty rates are lowest for car or van occupants at 201 passenger and 233 driver casualties per billion miles travelled. The next lowest is bus occupants with 289 casualties per billion miles travelled. The road user types which carry the most risk for older people are motorcyclists, pedal cyclists and pedestrians with casualty rates of 1,833, 1,711 and 1,014 per billion miles travelled respectively.</p>

                  <h2><b>Collisions involving older car drivers</b></h2>
                  <h3><p>Driver involvement in collisions by age</p></h3>
                  <p>Between ages 17 and 75, the rate of car or van drivers involved in collisions per billio
                    n vehicle miles travelled falls with driver age from 1,384 (drivers aged 17 to 24) to 211
                     (drivers aged 71 to 75). The rate increases in age between ages 76 to 85, before rising
                     sharply to the highest rate (2,014) for any group for drivers 86 and over (Chart 3a).</p>

                    <p> The number of drivers involved in collisions decreases with age (Chart 3b).
                      However, miles travelled rises as drivers get older, peaking with drivers in their
                      late-fifties, and then falls (Chart 3c). As a result, the high collision rates for
                      older drivers is associated with very low mileage and low number of collisions.</p>

                  <p>The KSI casualty rate for casualties in cars or vans driven by older drivers rose gradually between 2011 and 2019, though for casualties of all severities the equivalent rate remained broadly stable over this period. In contrast, there were declines in both the KSI and all severities casualty rates for cars or vans driven by drivers of any age.</p>
                  <p>There was a sharp decrease in all casualty rates during 2020, with a greater fall in rates for casualties in vehicles driven by an older driver compared with rates for casualties in vehicles driven by a driver of any age.</p>

          <h2><b>ROAD SAFETY MEASURES </b></h2>
          <p>There are many different techniques that can be used in the highway to improve road safety. The following notes
            describe a variety of measures aimed at controlling vehicle speeds and making conditions safer for both pedestrians
            and drivers. It is important to bear in mind that not all types of these ideas are appropriate for all site conditions. An
            idea of costs is also given, however, as described these can vary a lot depending on various features. In most
            cases it will be necessary to carry out alterations to street lighting to ensure that features are adequately illuminated.
            The cost of this is excluded from the costs quoted below and it can vary substantially, depending on local conditions,
            from about £600 for a single lighting column to several thousand pounds for a comprehensive review of the existing
            street lighting system. </p>

                    <b>Speed Table</b>
                    These take the form of a raised plateaux set across the road. They achieve significant speed
                    reduction and also make it easier and safer for pedestrians to cross the road on the top of the
                    table where speeds are at their lowest.
                    Speed tables can cause a degree of noticeable traffic noise where there is a regular
                    presence of certain types of goods vehicles and vehicles with trailers. Whilst such situations
                    are relatively few, special consideration needs to be given to their siting and also the chosen
                    profile of a speed table can have an effect on such matters.
                    <b> Cost (£)</b>
                    Dependant upon site constraints and appropriate specification for a particular site, the cost of
                    speed tables (usually including specific drainage facilities and adjusted surrounding footway
                    levels) can vary dramatically from £3,000 to £30,000 where a table covers a whole junction.
                    A general guideline cost would be in the region of £8,000. However, it should be noted that
                    such traffic calming techniques are best adopted in the form of a series where speeds are
                    contained over a length of road rather than at a single point.

                    <b> Speed Cushions</b>
                    These are similar to the speed table but take the form of small plateaux with a gap between
                    them. Whilst there are not as effective a speed reducing device as a speed table, speed
                    cushions allow wider vehicles to straddle them making it easier for buses and emergency
                    service appliances to pass along a route and still reduce the speed of the vast majority of
                    traffic.
                    <b> Cost (£)</b>
                    For a set of 2 cushions would be approximately £2,000. However, it should be noted that
                    such traffic calming techniques are best adopted in the form of a series where speeds are
                    contained over a length of road rather than at a single point.

                    <b>Footway Build-outs</b>
                    This is usually where the footway is built out into the carriageway to provide a better view
                    point for pedestrians wanting to cross the road. It is particularly beneficial near parked cars
                    (see sheltered parking) but can also be used as part of a chicane system (see chicanes and
                    priority narrowing).
                    Buildouts can be difficult to achieve where there are many private driveways restricting their
                    positioning.
                    <b> Cost (£)</b>
                    A build-out is normally furnished with bollards and dropped kerbs/tactile facility and usually
                    cost in the region of £4,000.

                    <b>Priority Narrowing</b>
                    This involves introducing a road narrowing which effectively creates a one-way priority
                    system at that point. The speed reducing effect of such a measure would rely upon the
                    regular presence of oncoming vehicles in order to ensure that traffic without priority has to
                    periodically give way and consequently reduce its speed.
                    Measures such as these can be difficult to achieve as they rely heavily on good visibility from
                    approaching drivers. The presence of private drives and side roads also restrict the
                    opportunities where priority narrowings can be placed.
                    <b> Cost (£)</b>
                    A single priority narrowing with associated signing and road markings may cost around
                    £6,000.

                    <b>Chicane</b>
                    This can take the form of a set or various sets of carriageway narrowings. The narrowing(s)
                    can allow two-way traffic flow or can give priority to drivers travelling in a certain direction
                    (see priority narrowing). The aim of chicanes is to break up the traffic flow and so reduce
                    vehicle speeds.
                    Measures such as these can be difficult to achieve as they rely heavily on good visibility from
                    approaching drivers. The presence of private drives and side roads also restricts
                    opportunities where chicanes can be placed.
                    <b> Cost (£)</b>
                    A chicane incorporating two narrowings with associated signing and road markings could
                    cost £12,000.

                  <td>
                    <b>Sheltered Parking</b>
                    This normally involves the introduction of footway or verge build-outs at the end of existing
                    sections of on–street parking. The parking would be defined by a white line or change in
                    carriageway surface. Whilst visually narrowing the appearance of the road, sheltered parking
                    offers a degree of protection to parked vehicles and the build-outs can provide safer points
                    for pedestrians to cross the road near to the parked vehicles.
                    Buildouts can be difficult to achieve where there are many private driveways restricting their
                    position.
                    <b> Cost (£)</b>
                    A section of sheltered parking, including bollards, signs and road markings, could cost
                    £10,000.
